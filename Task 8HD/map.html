This practice was part of a broader effort to assimilate Aboriginal people and erase their cultural and racial identity. The policy was driven by several beliefs:</p> </section>  <section>     <h5>Beliefs Behind the Policy</h5>     <ul>         <li>Aboriginals were a dying race: Europeans believed that Aboriginal people would eventually die out and saw interbreeding as a way to manage this perceived inevitability.</li>         <li>Australia was a 'white man's' country: The policy was part of a broader effort to maintain Australia as a predominantly white nation.</li>         <li>Erasing the black colour: By encouraging mixed-race marriages and subsequent generations, the aim was to gradually eliminate the physical characteristics associated with Aboriginal people.</li>     </ul>     <p>This policy was implemented during the era known as the Stolen Generation, roughly from 1909 to 1969. Many Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families and placed in institutions or with white families to be assimilated into white society.</p> </section>  <section>     <h5>Comparison with Other Countries</h5>     <p>The concept of "breeding out" a race has been seen in other contexts as well, though the specifics and motivations may differ:</p>     <ul>         <li><strong>United States:</strong> Various assimilation policies aimed at Native American populations, including forced removals and boarding schools.</li>         <li><strong>Canada:</strong> Similar to the US, with residential schools and policies to assimilate Indigenous populations.</li>         <li><strong>Nazi Germany:</strong> Eugenics policies aimed at creating a pure Aryan race through selective breeding and elimination of those considered racially inferior.</li>     </ul>     <p>These policies reflect broader trends in transnational history where colonial and imperial powers implemented strategies to assimilate or eliminate indigenous populations.</p> </section> </div>`)[0];
